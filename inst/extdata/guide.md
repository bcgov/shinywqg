### Step 2: Select value(s)
 - WQGs are derived to protect different values (e.g., aquatic life). Using this tab one or more WQGs derived to protect different values can be selected.

- A table will appear on the right showing information about the selected media (i.e., water or sediment), type of guideline (long-term chronic or short term acute), predicted effect level (i.e., no effect or probable effect), guidelines status (i.e., approved, interim or working), WQG value and the links to the guidelines’ technical report and overview report are provided. If the WQG is a working WQG, the link to the original source will be provided.
